### Technologies used : 
    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, React Hooks 

### Implemented task app 

Using react-rout-dom, I implemented Login, Home, and Not Found Pages.

We can add tasks with a description, Date, time, and Assigned User to the list.

And updated the task item and deleted it from the list.

I tried to build the app using authentication but couldn't because I got an internal server error.
